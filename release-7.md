## ü§ù Integrations

- Added "Kiosk" mode in the mobile Box Office app for Android

## üßπ Housekeeping
- Fix reporting issue where ‚Äòasked during registration‚Äô questions weren‚Äôt appearing in certain reports when answered during checkout.
- Fix double booking issues that occurred during failed off-site payments
- Fix a restocking bug that prevented seats being re-released when the reservation was manually completed by an admin user
- Fix some price range display issues where timeslot from prices were always showing as zero
- Customer Names now show on E-Tickets
- Improved Shop Search results to remove city/tag results with no associated events
- Limited ‚Äòfixed value discounts‚Äô to one Currency to avoid customers gaming exchange rates for higher value discounts.
- Multi image upload component fixed and applied to event gallery blocks
- Map blocks improved to show all events when none are hovered
- Improved Google Maps API help text and tooltips
- Fix: Item validation for min/max/multiple quantities was acting inconsistently in the basket, and when rebooking.
- Refactor: Basket error messages now display more context (i.e. the event name, item type, item name, that triggered the error). This is particularly useful where a user tries to add multiple items to their basket at once.
- Fix: Assigned visibility groups weren't correctly displaying on the venues index.
- Fix: Visibility group filtering wasn't being applied to the venues filter on seating plans index.
- Fix: Seating plans were not properly filtered by a user's visibility groups.
- Fix: Allowed editing of customer email addresses via admin, when using impersonation mode from the reseller.
- Fix: Honour the live mode flag on companies, in the sales based reports. This means demo transactions will no longer show up.
- Fix: When copying events with timeslots, some sale items (particularly add-ons) were being duplicated. Prevented this from happening.
- Fix: Access codes were being counted even if items purchased didn't require them.¬† We now remove access codes at the point of payment, where they aren't needed.
- Fix: Issue with seating plans not respecting disabled/deleted access codes, and seats still being marked as unavailable.
- Fix: Seating Plan cache when an access code is applied. The availability image of areas remained the same, as it was not considering that different customers should see different items.
- Fixed issues with exporting/downloading reports when we are filtering by email addresses
- (internal) Corrected the automatic Stripe invoice generation


## üíª Technical
- Fixed some blocking issues preventing the automatic audit backup script from always completing.
