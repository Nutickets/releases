# Release 6: May 24th - July 15th
Below you will find the summary notes for the 6th release of the Nuweb core platform.

## üöÄ New Features
- Added a new 'Payment Link' payment option when selling tickets via box office mode. This emails a unique secure URL to the customers email address allowing them to pay for their tickets within an allotted time.
- Added the ability to create access codes which allow organisers to hold seats or individual tickets from the public and lock them behind an access code:
    - Access codes can be applied either by visiting a unique URL or by entering the code manually. Manual code entry can be enabled/disabled globally.
    - Sale items restricted by the access code can only be purchased when using the access link, or entering the code. The items do not appear unless the code is entered and there is also the option to hide items outside of the applied access code.
    - Access codes also feature many of the settings available with discount codes such as max usages overall and per customer, validity dates and more.
    - Access codes have been added to sales reports, to allow the specific codes that were used, to be revealed.
- Added a quick-print option to the web-based box office mode upon completion of a sale
- Phase one of the season ticket roadmap has been launched with the option to setup pre-season season tickets. This is in request-only BETA mode until phase two is launched in the upcoming release.
- Added fractional tax band support
- Added support for same-day rebookings whereby customers can pick a different timeslot on the same day as their original booking
- Added the ability to issue online refunds for card-present stripe transactions made via our box office mobile app

### The Charity Package
- Introduced charities and donations into the checkout process. Organisers can setup one or many charities within their events and configure them to accept fixed-increment or user-specified donation amounts as well as several other donation-specific settings such as min/max price, charity website URL, charity logo etc.
- Implemented GiftAid collection and reporting which can be optionally enabled per charity and the giftaid rate can be configured at the account-level.
- Added a new "Donations Received" report alongside lots of new fields within existing reports for the new charity features

  - The default settings for the generated JustGiving pages can be configured per-event

### Localisation, dates and times

- Languages and countries will now display in the correct language according to the users preference.

### Stadiums and large seating plans
- Improved seating UI in shop / editor

- New smaller features: Opacity for shapes and icons. Accessibility, gates, stand, stairs and tags for GA. Row labels will stick to row ends even when seats are hidden. Plan background colour could be changed. UI to rotate / resize elements in editor
- Filters on the seating plan to search for price bands and tags, and in the editor any stand/stair/gate. It works with areas too.

## üíª Technical
- Refactored: Seating Plan Import Experience
    - Seating plan importing is now batched into smaller tasks, allowing larger plans to be imported more reliably.
    - Doing this also means that other customers/clients aren't impacted whilst we wait for a large plan to import.
    - The UI has been updated to show the progress so that the spinner has more context than 'please wait'.
- Refactored: Bulk Event Copying + Bulk Timeslot Creation Experience
    - As with the seating plan changes, the copy event + bulk timeslot processes were refined in order to utilise the same batching process as with seating plans.
- Add: A delta availability payload on seating planned events, in the shop.
    - This allows a much smaller amount of data to be downloaded, to keep seating plan availability up-to-date, by passing a 'last updated' timestamp and receiving a delta payload of any changes since then.
- Refactored: Availability information for seating plans, to be more performant - especially on larger seating plans.
- Cookie banner now respects the ‚Äòbase domain‚Äô setting in Admin (if available) to allow cookie banner to work on custom domains.

### API Updates
- Added full set of API endpoints to accomodate offline entry scanning
- Added NFC pairing API endpoints allowing tickets to be paired with NFC tags
- Added a 'lastUpdated' filter to several endpoints (GET /customers, GET /orders/items, GET/events) to allow filtering of data based on the modified time
- Various fields have been added to make linking and filtering data easier: Customer ID has been added to any endpoints that include order information, added the ability to include order items when retrieving orders in bulk, added separate first and last name fields when retrieving customers, add created and updated at timestamps to all events and tickets, added event ID where missing, made eventId optional when retrieving tickets, restructured event codes to lighten the payloads for accounts that have lots of internal data capture questions.
